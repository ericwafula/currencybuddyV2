## Architecture & Modularization

Currency Buddy V2 has been designed with a focus on modularity and separation of concerns. The project follows both layered and feature-based modularization strategies:

- **Core Module:**
    - **Data Layer:** Handles data retrieval, caching, and network operations.
    - **Domain Layer:** Contains business logic and use cases.
    - **Presentation Layers:**
        - `presentation:ui` for UI components that can be shared across features.
        - `presentation:designsystem` for reusable UI elements and theming.

- **Current Feature Modules:**
    - **converter:** Focuses on the currency conversion feature, with its own set of layers to keep functionality isolated and testable.
  
**Coming Soon:**
    - **auth:** Manages the onboarding flow with dedicated layers for data, domain, and presentation.

This structure not only helps in maintaining clear boundaries between different parts of the app but also paves the way for easier scalability and testing.
